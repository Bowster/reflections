How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

This highlighted the lines which differed between the two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because if you make mistakes in the new version you can easily restore back to  previos working copy

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros
More logical breakpoints
Files more likely to compile

Cons
Requires more methodical approach - may forget to commit


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

They are designed for different situations

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log will show all the commits - have to scroll down to view appropriate commit
Use q to exit log
Use Git diff to compare original file (first) whether new file (second)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because you can always go back to a previous version that doesn't have the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For version control of web page development
